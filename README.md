# Game of Thrones Characters and U.S. Baby Names
*This project investigates the effect, if any, that TV show "Game of Thrones" had on American baby names by comparing a list of names from the year 2010 (series premiere was April 17, 2011) and the year 2019 (the last episode of the series aired on May 19, 2019). If my theory is correct, specific character names will either grow in the number of instances and/or make an appearance where there previously wasn't. Names researched include: Arya, Brienne, Cersei, Daenerys, Jon, Jorah, Khaleesi, Margaery, Samwell, Sansa, Theon, Tyrion.*

## Goals and Features Used For This Project
1. Read data in: I read in data from two .csv files with the pandas read_ function, then combined two dataframes into one.
2. Manipulate and clean data: I used pandas to remove null values in the dataframe.
3. Analyze the data: I used pandas to select rows in the dataframe based on specified conditions (Name), which pulled the data I needed and helped me determine whether specific GOT character names appeared in the dataset; and the comparison of the appearances between 2010 and 2019.
4. Visualize the data: Plot the name data to see which name was the most popular of the designated characters. 
5. Interpret data and graphical output: I wrote markdown cells in my Jupyter notebook explaining my thought process and code.
