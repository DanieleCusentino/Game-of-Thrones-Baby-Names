## Goals For This Project
1. Read in data from a csv file with the pandas read_ function.
2. Manipulate the data by converting a txt file to csv, then adding headers to clean up the file.
3. Analyze the data (32072 rows) into usable information to determine whether GOT character names show up in the dataset.
4. Plot the name data to see which name was the most popular of the designated characters.
